# Bad Package Manager

A bad package manager. For science!

The goal of this project is to build a CLI app in order to test new features in Node.js. One day it might be a great CLI app but it will probably never be a good package manager.

> **Warning**
> This project is for experimental purposes only. You should not use this package manager for... anything.
